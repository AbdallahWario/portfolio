    "bio": "Hi there! I am Aballah Wario!. I've been coding for over 5 years now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming developers. With this passion, I help my friends learn JS and later introduce them to React. Through live coaching sessions on Google Meet, I have  demonstrated how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and challenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects to help my friends and anyone interested enter the world of web development. ",
